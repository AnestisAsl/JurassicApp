# Paleontologist

## Description<br>



A full stack Web Application with the tech stack listed bellow.The user has the ability to see where and when dinosaurs fossils were discovered using an interactive map, compare dinosaurs characteristics with interactive charts and see some of the dinosaurs classifications with visual and also interactive way. I created my own API that delivers information from my local **postgreSQL** database using the **Apollo-GraphQL** stack. The project as a **Next.js** app was created using the command
```
npx create-next-app@latest --ts
```
and then the modules and libraries(*listed below*) were installed using npm.
The UI was mainly created with **Shadcn** componenets that I modified accordingly. Shadcn was also used for the charts and **React Flow** was used for the dinosaurs classification.A map was also introduced in the latest release using the **React Simple Maps** JS library.
